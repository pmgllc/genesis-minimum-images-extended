Allows for changing the "banner" image in Minimum 2.0 posts to not be the featured image.

== Description ==

Allows for changing the "banner" image in Minimum 2.0 posts to not be the featured image. There are times you won't want the banner image for a post to be the featured image due to aspect ratios or simply wanting them to be different images for the blog index, homepage thumbnails, Facebook, Pinterest, etc.

This is intended for the child theme Minimum 2.0 for the Genesis framework. We plan on expanding the child themes and functionality as it evolves and StudioPress releases more themes that use featured images to enhance the design but where developers and users may want extended options.

== Installation ==

1. Upload contents of the directory to /wp-content/plugins/ (or use the automatic installer)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. In any post or page, upload an image in the new Minimum Image metabox.
1. Verify it works!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with child themes other than Minimum 2.0? =

Not yet, but we're working on code for that.

= What, exactly does it do, again? =

Let's say you've made a beautiful "banner" image for a post that measures 1600x200px and made it the post's featured image so it appears below the header. Then you go to your homepage or blog index page and see a sliver of an image that is, say, 300x38px. That's because the banner image is the featured image and the featured images are used elsewhere. With an extreme aspect ratio like that, it messes up thumbnails.

== Screenshots ==

1. An example homepage with featured images at "banner" aspect ratios are varying and very hard to see.
2. Pinterest is unable to use any image other than the post's featured image when you use the Pin It button.
3. Using GMIE to create a new banner image, you can then have a normal aspect ratio image for the featured image, allowing for attractive social sharing.
